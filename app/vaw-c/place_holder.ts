Maria can report the abuse to her local **barangay officials**, who are required to provide immediate assistance by issuing a **Barangay Protection Order (BPO)** to prevent further violence and restrict her husband’s access to her. She can also file a **Temporary Protection Order (TPO)** or **Permanent Protection Order (PPO)** through the court to ensure her and her children’s safety. Additionally, Maria can access counseling, shelter, and other support services through the **Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD)** or local women’s advocacy organizations. Legal aid groups can assist her in pursuing criminal charges against Juan, who may face imprisonment and fines for his actions. These combined measures will ensure Maria’s safety, end her dependence, and provide her with the tools needed to rebuild her life free from abuse.",
