Maria should file a formal criminal complaint against Juan with the local police or prosecutor’s office, which will investigate the incident. The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or local law enforcement can gather evidence and build a case to ensure that Juan is held accountable. Simultaneously, Maria can seek protection through legal remedies, such as securing a protection order if needed. With the support of the local women’s advocacy group, Maria can access counseling and trauma support services to address the emotional and psychological effects of the attack. Legal aid organizations can help her navigate the criminal justice system and ensure her case progresses. If Juan is found guilty, he can face penalties such as imprisonment, fines, and other criminal sanctions under the Anti-Rape Law. These combined efforts will provide Maria with justice, safety, and the resources needed to heal and rebuild her life.",
